  desc: "Hi There! I am Abhinav Raj, a final Year undergrad, currently majoring in Electrical Engineering from IIT ISM Dhanbad. I have tinkered with various things from web dev to game dev, robots to deep learning techniques. I have become jack of many trades but I aspire to be master of one. I crave knowledge. I keep its application through engineering and innovation in my highest regards. I do competitive coding and and have some experience in MERN stack. Making machine do something with a few lines of code is a powerful means to bring actual, practical changes and I aspire to be better in that.",
